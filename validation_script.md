Please randomly select 10 nodes and 10 edges from each label and relationship type, and verify against what you would expect by looking and validating inside the codebase Vista-M-source-code. Also validate the total number of nodes and edges of each type that you would expect. Also validate the schema on each node type and edge type. If there are any things that are wrong, or that should be changed/improved, report back on that.
