# Pure Discovery-First Approach for VistA-M Repository Analysis

## Overview

The pure discovery-first approach involves exhaustive extraction of all patterns from the VistA-M repository before making any assumptions about graph schema. This methodology prioritizes comprehensive understanding over speed, ensuring no important patterns are missed.

## Philosophy

- **Zero Assumptions**: Extract everything without preconceived notions of what's important
- **Pattern-Driven**: Let the data reveal its natural structure
- **Evidence-Based**: All schema decisions backed by empirical discovery
- **Comprehensive**: Better to over-extract than miss critical patterns

## Phase 1: Comprehensive Extraction Engine (Week 1-2)

### Objective
Extract **everything** from every file in the VistA-M repository without making assumptions about what matters.

### Implementation

```python
class PureVistADiscoveryParser:
    """Extract EVERYTHING - make no assumptions about what matters"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.raw_extractions = {
            'all_tokens': [],           # Every word, symbol, operator
            'all_patterns': [],         # Every regex match found
            'all_structures': [],       # Every hierarchical relationship
            'all_sequences': [],        # Every ordered occurrence
            'all_frequencies': {},      # Count of everything
            'all_contexts': [],         # Context around every pattern
            'all_anomalies': []         # Things that don't fit patterns
        }
    
    def extract_everything_from_line(self, line, context):
        """Extract every identifiable element from a single line"""
        line_data = {
            'raw_line': line,
            'line_length': len(line),
            'whitespace_prefix': len(line) - len(line.lstrip()),
            'character_frequency': dict(collections.Counter(line)),
            'context': context,
            
            # Token-level extraction
            'all_words': re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', line),
            'all_numbers': re.findall(r'\b\d+\b', line),
            'all_symbols': re.findall(r'[^\w\s]', line),
            'all_quoted_strings': re.findall(r'"[^"]*"', line),
            'all_parenthesized': re.findall(r'\([^)]*\)', line),
            'all_bracketed': re.findall(r'\[[^\]]*\]', line),
            
            # Pattern-level extraction (cast wide net)
            'caret_patterns': re.findall(r'\^[A-Z0-9$%]*\([^)]*\)', line),
            'dollar_patterns': re.findall(r'\$\$?[A-Z0-9$%]*', line),
            'equals_assignments': re.findall(r'[A-Z0-9$%]+=', line),
            'command_like_patterns': re.findall(r'\b[A-Z]\b', line),
            'goto_like_patterns': re.findall(r'\b[A-Z0-9]+\^[A-Z0-9]+', line),
            'date_like_patterns': re.findall(r'\b\d{6,8}\b', line),
            'comment_patterns': re.findall(r';.*$', line),
            
            # Character class analysis
            'alpha_count': sum(c.isalpha() for c in line),
            'digit_count': sum(c.isdigit() for c in line),
            'punct_count': sum(c in string.punctuation for c in line),
            'upper_count': sum(c.isupper() for c in line),
            'lower_count': sum(c.islower() for c in line),
        }
        
        return line_data
```

### Key Activities

1. **Repository Scanning**: Process every file, regardless of type
2. **Line-by-Line Analysis**: Extract all tokens, patterns, and structures
3. **Context Preservation**: Maintain full context for every extraction
4. **Frequency Analysis**: Count occurrences of everything
5. **Anomaly Detection**: Identify anything that doesn't fit patterns

### Expected Output

- **Scale**: Gigabytes of extracted data
- **Coverage**: 100% of repository files
- **Granularity**: Individual character level up to file level
- **Format**: Structured JSON with complete extraction data

        }
        
        return patterns
    
    def discover_lexical_patterns(self):
        """Find patterns in how words/tokens are used"""
        # Comprehensive word analysis
        # Symbol frequency analysis
        # Case pattern analysis
        # Length distribution analysis

        # Cross-file identifier analysis
        # Reference pattern discovery
        # Communication pattern analysis
```

## Phase 3: Complete Pattern Analysis (Week 4)

### Objective
Comprehensive analysis of all discovered patterns to identify potential entities, relationships, and structures.

### Analysis Framework

#### Entity Candidate Discovery
```python
def discover_entity_candidates(patterns):
    """What things could be entities in our graph?"""
    
    candidates = {}
    
    # Files themselves are clearly entities
    candidates['File'] = {
        'evidence': 'Distinct file paths in repository',
        'count': file_count,
        'attributes': ['file_path', 'file_size', 'total_lines']
    }
    
    # Multi-file identifiers might be entities
    candidates['CrossFileIdentifier'] = {
        'evidence': 'Identifiers appearing in multiple files',
        'count': cross_ref_count,
        'examples': top_cross_refs
    }
    
    return candidates
```

#### Relationship Candidate Discovery
- Hierarchical relationships (containment)
- Reference relationships (dependencies)
- Sequential relationships (flow)
- Communication relationships (interfaces)

#### Constraint Discovery
- Naming conventions
- Structure requirements
- Pattern constraints
- Validation rules

---

## Phase 4: Schema Derivation (Week 5)

### Objective
Generate **all possible** schema interpretations from discovered patterns.

### Schema Generation Strategy

#### Pattern-Based Schemas
Generate one schema for each major pattern cluster discovered.

#### Entity-Combination Schemas
Generate schemas from different combinations of discovered entities.

#### Goal-Oriented Schemas
Generate schemas optimized for different analysis goals:
- Code understanding
- Architecture analysis
- Data flow analysis
- Security audit
- Performance analysis
- Modernization planning

### Evaluation Framework

```python
def evaluate_all_schemas(schemas, discovery_data):
    """Evaluate every possible schema against the actual data"""
    
    for schema in schemas:
        evaluation = {
            'coverage_score': calculate_coverage_score(schema, discovery_data),
            'complexity_score': calculate_complexity_score(schema),
            'usefulness_score': calculate_usefulness_score(schema, discovery_data),
            'implementability_score': calculate_implementability_score(schema),
            'completeness_score': calculate_completeness_score(schema, discovery_data)
        }
        
        evaluation['total_score'] = sum(evaluation.values())
```
