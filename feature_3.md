## FEATURE:

Implement Phase 3 and Phase 3 ONLY of vista_graph_implementation_roadmap.md after reading through the whole file. 


## DOCUMENTATION:

The source code for Vista is in Vista-M-source-code folder

## CONSIDERATIONS:

Phases 1-2 have already been completed. 
Before starting Phase 3, check to see if any parts of Phases 1-2 were already completed fully or partially during the Phase 1-2 implementation. In general, check to see what has already been implemented and what the current graph looks like before beginning. 

## APPROACHES:
When it comes to implementing the MUMPS parser, I want you to create two git worktrees, one for emcellent and one for a custom parser, and then compare at the end and decide which one to proceed with.
